There are also some potential drawbacks to using lazy loading in a computer application:

Increased development and testing effort: Implementing lazy loading can require a significant amount of additional development and testing effort, as it requires the application to be designed in a way that allows resources to be loaded on demand. This can be particularly challenging for applications with complex resource dependencies, as it may be necessary to carefully plan the order in which resources are loaded to ensure that the application functions correctly.

Decreased user experience: While lazy loading can help to create a more seamless user experience in some cases, it can also have the opposite effect if not implemented properly. If resources are not loaded quickly enough, the user may experience delays or disruptions as they interact with the application.

Increased complexity: Lazy loading can also increase the complexity of an application, as it requires the implementation of additional logic to track and manage the loading of resources. This can make the application more difficult to maintain and debug, and may require additional testing to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

Compatibility issues: Lazy loading may not be compatible with all browsers or devices, particularly if it relies on newer technologies or features that are not supported by all browsers. This can limit the potential user base for the application, and may require additional development effort to ensure that it is compatible with a wide range of platforms.
