# ScrollSnapShowcase: Lazy-Loading-Pattern
This is a small webpage built with HTML and CSS to showcase a lazy-loading container with rows of user data. It uses CSS animations and scroll-snap to provide a smooth and interactive experience to the user

## Installation

## Usage 
The page will load with an empty lazy-loading container. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to trigger the lazy-loading mechanism and load additional user rows.
Each row contains two columns, the first one displaying the user's ID and the second one displaying their name. The rows have a scroll-snap effect that ensures a smooth scrolling experience.
Additionally, a scroll-down button is provided at the bottom center of the page, with a pulsing animation, inviting the user to scroll down to discover more content.
